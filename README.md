# Coolnotifs!

Yeah, coolnotifs. Lets you make some sick ass notifications with python.

I still have to implement ellipsis, but you could probably just modify it to have that yourself if you really need it already.

# Usage:

Very simple!

So, i'd reccomend you do

from coolnotifs import sendnotif

so you can just do 

sendnotif("Attention!", "This is a cool notification!", "coolimage.png")

but, you could also just do 
import coolnotif

and do

coolnotif.sendnotif("Attention!", "This is a cool notification!", "coolimage.png")

if you'd prefer that.

I won't be documenting the other functions you can find in there, as they aren't really meant to be used outside of the "library" itself.
