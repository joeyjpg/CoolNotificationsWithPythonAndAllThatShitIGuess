# Coolnotifs!

Yeah, coolnotifs. Lets you make some sick ass notifications with python.

I still have to implement ellipsis, but you could probably just modify it to have that yourself if you really need it already.

# Usage:

from coolnotifs import sendnotif

sendnotif("Important!", "This is a notification.", "/home/burger/burger.png")


should do.


To change the default image (what shows if you don't supply an image), just overwrite the Default.png file with a different, preferably square image.
